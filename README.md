## Creating a KV Database Instance

Follow the steps outlined in the [quick start guide](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/quickstart#create-a-kv-database) provided by Vercel. This guide will assist you in creating and configuring your KV database instance on Vercel, enabling your application to interact with it.

Remember to update your environment variables (`KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`) in the `.env` file with the appropriate credentials provided during the KV database setup.


## Running locally
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
